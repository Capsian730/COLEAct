Cost Of Living Elimination (COLE) Act - Draft Proposal
Welcome to the repository for the Cost Of Living Elimination (COLE) Act, a visionary draft proposal to make life more affordable and equitable for all citizens. The COLE Act aims to eliminate basic living costs—housing, food, healthcare, and financial access—while simplifying taxes and stabilizing the economy. By streamlining systems and prioritizing fairness, it supports stronger communities and single-income households, giving families the freedom to thrive.
Key Features:
    • Simplified Taxes: A fair, easy-to-understand flat tax system with a low business tax and an economic flow tax to fund public benefits, ensuring no one dodges their share. 
    • Universal Healthcare: A single, government-funded system covering all essential care, with fair prices set by doctors, ending surprise bills and overcharging. 
    • Free Food Access: Guaranteed income for farmers and free food for citizens through a streamlined system, merging programs like SNAP and WIC with no-cost grocery and restaurant access. 
    • Public Banking: A central bank offering free accounts, housing debt forgiveness, and savings-based purchases, while curbing predatory housing practices but allowing flexibility for vehicle and credit card loans. 
    • Worker Support: Retraining and job guarantees for those affected by the transition, ensuring no citizen is left behind. 
This is a public discussion draft, not an official bill. We invite citizens, policymakers, and advocates to explore the COLE Act, provide feedback, and contribute ideas to shape a fairer future. Check back for updates, review the revisions, and join the conversation to make life better for all!
